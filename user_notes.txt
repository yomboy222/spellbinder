note from users (alpha-testers)

give reasons why some words don't work (like slim)?

drink java get extra points

in tare/dicer, say treasure too far away to transform?

trash/lobster, make sure splash sound is pre-loaded -- on ipad?

keep playing current level after solving??

why does splash sound not work on chrome?

feelings on capitalized versions of word ... coke and tang? spam?

do people want more text prompts / hints?
