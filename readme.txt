TODO:
background music
re-draw bridge
remaining pictures: warts, arts, treasure, parts, strap, heel, boar, MAP!
draw piece of paper in drawer when first opening
better collision detection for portcullis
re-record host message to say goal is to get treasure chest
new player avatar
make words etc. more level-specific (part of level data instead of separate)
make stream flowing (using 2nd image)

PHASE 2 STUFF:
make stuff not pile up when you discard multiple things
check to make sure you can't discard something through a wall etc.
